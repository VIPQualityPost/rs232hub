# rs232hub
This is a small project to make a USB-RS232 four port hub for use with SCPI commands for making an easy, automated testing controller. 
I successfully made the prototype with just one channel, but for the final design I want to incorporate a 4 port USB hub controller so I can have several devices connected at once.
I don't need USB3.0 speed so this will not include that, but it will feature a USB-C port to be consistent with other designs I have made (and I still have several connectors left over from previous projects)
